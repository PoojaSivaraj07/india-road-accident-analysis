🚗 Road Accident Analysis and Reduction Strategies for India
📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data from India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualizations to uncover important patterns.
It aims to identify high-risk factors such as time of day, weather, road conditions, alcohol involvement, and driver demographics that contribute to accidents.
The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to help reduce accident rates and improve road safety across the country.

📈 Project Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on accident datasets.

Visualize accident patterns across different categories.

Identify high-risk states, times, and conditions.

Recommend strategies to minimize road accidents in India.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Plotly

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Insights
Most accidents occur during early mornings (3 AM, 5–8 AM) and late evenings (9–10 PM).

Fatigue, poor lighting, alcohol consumption, and overspeeding are major causes.

Poor road conditions and weather (e.g., wet roads) significantly increase accident severity.

Younger and mid-aged drivers are more involved in accidents.

📢 Recommendations
Stricter law enforcement and night-time patrolling.

Road lighting improvements during high-risk hours.

Anti-alcohol driving awareness campaigns.

Weather-related alerts for drivers during dangerous conditions.

Targeted driving training programs for younger and mid-aged drivers.

Immediate action plans for roads under construction.
